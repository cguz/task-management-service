## Description

The goal of this service is to handle the execution of multiple types of Tasks. 

### Requirements

* A Task can be executed instantly or can be scheduled for later execution;
* A Task can be in one of the following states: QUEUED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED;
* Failed Tasks shall not have any side effects;
* A user can cancel Tasks using the Task Management Service.

### Examples of the Tasks to execute:

* Batch data load to a data warehouse;
* Index files;
* Send notifications.


## Design 

The design is in the folder ( üìÅ ) ["design"](https://github.com/cguz/task-management-service/tree/main/design)

The class diagram is as follow:

The state transition of a task is as follow:

The states are:

* QUEUED : means that the tasks are planned for their execution.
* RUNNING : means that the tasks are executing.
* SUCCESS : means that the tasks finish successfully.
* FAILED : means that the task fails during its execution.

We added two more states:

* CANCEL : means that the user cancels the task.
* PAUSED : means that the task is stopped and can be resumed. 
  
## Development

The source code in C++ is in the folder ( üìÅ ) ["src/cplusplus/"](https://github.com/cguz/task-management-service/tree/main/src/cplusplus)
